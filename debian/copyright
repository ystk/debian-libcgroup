    As a special exception, you may create a larger work that contains part or
    all of the Bison parser skeleton and distribute that work under terms of
    your choice, so long as that work isn't itself a parser generator using the
    skeleton or a modified version thereof as a parser skeleton.
    Alternatively, if you modify or redistribute the parser skeleton itself,
    you may (at your option) remove this special exception, which will cause
    the skeleton and the resulting Bison output files to be licensed under the
    GNU General Public License without this special exception.

    This special exception was added by the Free Software Foundation in version
    2.2 of Bison.

These files are autogenerated by bison at build-time. As a result of the bison
exception, the upstream authors wish to release these works under the GNU
Lesser General Public License version 2.1.
