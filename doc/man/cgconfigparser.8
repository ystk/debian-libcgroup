Parses the control groups configuration file
Sets up the control group file system
defined by the configuration file and mounts
mount points defined by the configuration file.

\fBcgconfig.conf\fR. This option can be used multiple times and can be mixed
with \fB-L\fR option.

.TP
.B -L, --load-directory=DIR
Finds all files in given directory and parses them in alphabetical order
like they were specified by \fB-l\fR option. This option can be used
multiple times and can be mixed with \fB-l\fR option.

.TP
.B -a <agid>:<auid>
defines the default owner of the
rest of the defined control groupâ€™s files. These users are
allowed to set subsystem parameters and create subgroups.
The default value is the same as has the parent cgroup.

.TP
.B -d, --dperm=mode
sets the default permissions of a control groups directory.
The permissions needs to be specified as octal numbers e.g.
\fB-d 775\fR.

.B -f, --fperm=mode
sets the default permissions of the control group files.
The permissions needs to be specified as octal numbers e.g.

others permissions to the owners permissions).

sets the default permissions of the control group tasks files.
The permissions needs to be specified as octal numbers e.g.

others permissions to the owners permissions).
