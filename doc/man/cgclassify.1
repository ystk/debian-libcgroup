.SH NAME
cgclassify \- move running task(s) to given cgroups

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBcgclassify\fR [\fB-g\fR <\fIcontrollers>:<path\fR>] [--sticky] <\fIpidlist\fR>

.SH DESCRIPTION
this command moves processes defined by the list
of processes
(\fBpidlist\fR)
to given control groups.

The pids in the pidlist are separated by spaces

.TP
.B -g <controllers>:<path>
defines control groups where the task will be moved.
\fBcontrollers\fR is a list of controllers and
\fBpath\fR is the relative path to control groups
in the given controllers list.

This flag can be used multiple times to
define multiple pairs of lists of controllers
and relative paths.
Instead of the list of all mounted controllers,
wildcard \fB*\fR can be used.

If this option is not used then
\fBcgclassify\fR will automatically place the task to the
control group based on \fB/etc/cgrules.conf\fR.

.TP
.B --sticky
If this option is used, the daemon of service cgred (cgrulesengd
process) does not change both the specified \fBpidlist\fR and their
children tasks. Without this option, the daemon does not change the
specified \fBpidlist\fR but it changes their children tasks to the
right cgroup based on \fB/etc/cgrules.conf\fR automatically.
